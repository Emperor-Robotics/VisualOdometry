Project: Proposal
===

## 1. Suggestions for projects
<!-- three projects from list three simple bullet points -->
- Robot club TB3 [Track and push ball to goal]
  - Tracks a ball using machine vision
  - Robot is tasked to move ball into the goal
  - Pretty cool, reminiscent of Robo-Soccer
- Turtlebot 3 Maze Explorer
  - Seems to use a bug type algorithm
  - Smooth navigation of really confined rooms
  - Code explaination though
- Multi Robot Exploration
  - Really neat for swarm robotics
  - Multiple robots mapping an environment
  - multi robot collaboration (Broadcast and request help)
<!-- three bullet points from your own project idea -->

Our Project Idea:
- 

## 2. Research code and demonstrate processing

## 3. Exploratory Program
### Team and expected contributions
- Kadyn Martinez
